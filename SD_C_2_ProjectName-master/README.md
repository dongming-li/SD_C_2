Based on sites such as Blackboard and Canvas, our projects focus will be creating an educational site catering to educators- focusing on features that streamline education ultimately benefiting the students. The project thus can be broken into two prominent components that make up the the site:


A Virtual Classroom: Just like blackboard and canvas, educators need to interact with their students. Central to such an interaction is a ‘virtual classroom’ where educators can make announcements, share files and message their pupils. Unlike Blackboard and Canvas however, the virtual classroom is not just an announcement bulletin board; but rather a teaching tool similar to tophat. For our project we plan to include:

* Announcements

* File uploading area

* Presentation Tool

* Customization (the look of the virtual classroom)

* Student progression tracking

* Grading

* ...



An Educator's Forum: The site will also feature an area where teachers can interact. With virtual classrooms, teachers have the option of viewing the work of their peers - providing a chance for an exchange of ideas, material and recommendations. Such interaction is of course optional - but it allows educators access to proven-to-work material and teaching methods. Features here include:

* The ability to search for classes (including narrowing searches by subject area) and/or material

* Option to share/exchange class material - test questions, modules, etc.

* Following a virtual classroom

* Ability to provide feedback to peers
